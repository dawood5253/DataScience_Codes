# Sentiment Analysis on Jane Austen Datasets

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing sentiment analysis on Jane Austen's texts using Python. The notebook utilizes natural language processing techniques to analyze the sentiment expressed in the texts and visualize the results using word clouds.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- AFINN
- WordCloud
- Matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk afinn wordcloud matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/jane-austen-sentiment-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Jupyter Notebook (`jane_austen_sentiment_analysis.ipynb`).

```bash
cd jane-austen-sentiment-analysis
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `jane_austen_sentiment_analysis.ipynb` notebook in your browser.

5. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute each cell.

6. Interpret the results generated by the sentiment analysis and word cloud visualizations.

## Interpreting the Results

The notebook performs the following steps:

- **Text Preprocessing**: The Jane Austen texts are preprocessed, including tokenization and cleaning.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment analysis is conducted using lexicon-based approaches (AFINN and Bing Liu Lexicon). The sentiment scores for each word in the texts are calculated, aggregated for each document, and classified into positive or negative sentiments.

- **Visualization**: Word clouds are generated to visualize words associated with positive and negative sentiments.

Interpret the sentiment analysis results based on the following:

- **Aggregate Sentiment Scores**: Positive aggregate scores indicate positive sentiments, while negative aggregate scores indicate negative sentiments.

- **Word Clouds**: Words appearing in the word clouds are indicative of sentiments expressed in the texts. Larger words represent higher frequency or stronger association with sentiments.

Feel free to modify the notebook and explore additional analyses as needed.
